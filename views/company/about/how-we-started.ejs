        <p id="first-paragraph">
          Our story starts in October 2021. I received an email.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We’re firing you because we can. And there’s nothing you can do about
          it.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, that’s not what it really said but it was the truth. I was a
          contractor for a speech-to-text company. I’d worked with them for five
          years at that point. It was the only job I’d had since leaving high
          school. From my earnings, I could pay for college, pay rent and feed
          myself. And with that email, a relatively comfortable life became
          stress-filled.

        <h4 class="paragraph-title-even-margin">YouTube binge and an idea</h4>
        <p>
          The stress of needing to redo my budget, find another job and not
          knowing whether I’d be able to make rent really got to me. I found
          myself self-medicating by bingeing on YouTube videos. I’d sometimes
          watch videos from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed,
          while applying for jobs on my laptop (sometimes).
        </p>
        <p>In my binge, I noticed one thing…</p>
        <p>
          See, the thing I used to do for my previous employer was create closed
          captions for conferences, lectures and occasionally, YouTube videos.
          And since I was watching a lot of new stuff, I’d come across so many
          words that I wasn’t familiar with, jargon from different industries.
          I’d turn on closed captions to see what new word had been used. Most
          videos only had auto-generated captions. YouTube adds these captions
          for free to most videos uploaded on their platform. But these captions
          aren't the most accurate. So sometimes the captions would be pretty
          useless to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I was really interested, I’d research a bit to find the word.
          Knowing what the YouTuber was talking about would get me really
          engaged with the video. And I got to learn so many things from
          different creators.
        </p>
        <h4 class="paragraph-title-even-margin">The idea</h4>
        <p>
          This got me thinking, “I’ve been creating closed captions for years. I
          can’t be the only one who needs closed captions for the videos I’m
          watching. What about hard-of-hearing audiences? They could get a lot
          from having accurate closed captions.”
        </p>
        <p>
          So I started reaching out to the creators whose content I enjoyed. I
          offered to create closed captions for their videos. In a couple of
          months, I’d gotten to work with a few awesome creators and enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really believed in the usefulness of closed captions so I thought of
          scaling. My brother and a lot of my friends had also been laid off by
          the company we worked for. And whenever I had huge projects, I’d get
          their help. I approached my brother with the idea of starting a closed
          captions for YouTube company. It was exciting!

        <p>And the rest is history.</p>
